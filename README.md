Automated-students-short-answers-assessment
This project aims to streamline the workload of educators by implementing a system where they can upload two files: one containing problems and standard answers, and the other containing problems and students' answers. These files are then processed by our proficient deep learning model, which generates scores based on the similarity between the two sets of files. The project utilizes React for the frontend, Python for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.
