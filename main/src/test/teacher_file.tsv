Question	Model Answer	Concepts
What is an algorithm?	An algorithm is a well-defined sequence of steps or rules that provides a solution to a specific problem. It serves as a blueprint for performing a task and can be expressed in natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming languages.	sequence;steps;rules;specific problem;blueprint;task
Explain the concept of recursion in programming.	Recursion in programming refers to a method where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It breaks down complex issues into simpler sub-problems, solving them iteratively until a base case is reached, preventing infinite recursion.	function calls itself;problem;base case;infinite recursion;sub-problems
How does a binary search algorithm work?	A binary search algorithm works by efficiently locating a target value within a sorted array. The procedure involves dividing the array into halves and comparing the middle element with the target value. If the middle element equals the target, the search ends. Otherwise, if the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array; if greater, in the upper half. The process repeats until the target is found or the entire array is searched.	sorted array;target value;middle element;lower half;upper half
